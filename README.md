# 👻 Ghost Open Standard (GoS)

## Open Specification for Resilient IoT / IIoT / Field Automation Systems

---

## 🎯 Vision

Ghost Open Standard defines an open architecture model for building:

- IoT systems
- IIoT systems
- field automation
- home automation
- phygital systems
- distributed interactive environments

It enables **resilient**, **low-coupling**, **hardware-agnostic** systems based on:

```
capabilities
contracts
graphs
identity
resilience
layer separation
```

The standard specifies how distributed nodes **identify themselves**, **expose capabilities**, **communicate**, **process data**, **orchestrate automation**, and **remain resilient** — including offline operation.

Ghost is not a product. Ghost is a **standard**.

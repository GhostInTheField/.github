===============

GhostInTheField hosts the **Ghost Open Standard**.

Make everything smart by creating an architectural model implemented for:
- IoT systems
- IIoT systems
- field automation
- home automation
- phygital systems
- distributed interactive environments
  

Ghost is an open architectural foundation for distributed automation systems, built around:

-   persistent identity
-   versioned event contracts
-   capability abstraction
-   transport independence
-   resilience by design

Core specification:

-   Ghost-RFC-0001 --- Core Principles
-   Ghost-RFC-0002 --- Identity Model
-   Ghost-RFC-0003 --- Message Contract
-   Ghost-RFC-0004 --- Capability Model

Open. Specification-first. Implementation-neutral.
